This is the source code for the website. The key thing this website does is **dynamic loading from a Google Sheet**: 
the events list is loaded from a public Google Sheet. We edit the sheet, the website immediately reflects the changes.
No pushing HTML! :) Feel free to take the idea and run with it.
